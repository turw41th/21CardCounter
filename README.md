## DISCLAIMER:
I do not support cheating or attempting to do so in any way. Counting cards at blackjack is, although frowned upon by casinos, not illegal and can even be learned and used without a computer. Nevertheless do I not recommend using this software for real money games.

## Description
This is a fun little project that came to my mind while playing some online blackjack. The code is not very elegant but does it's job. I will probably improve it and extend it's functionaliy in the future.
