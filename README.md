## DISCLAIMER:
I do not support cheating or attempting to do so in any way. Counting cards at blackjack is, although frowned upon by casinos, not illegal and can even be learned and used without a computer. Nevertheless do I not recommend using this software for real money games.

## Desciption
This is a fun little project that came to my mind while playing some online blackjack. The code is not very elegant and does not (yet) check for valid inputs etc. Invalid inputs will not be calculated, but they do influence the calculated number of cards already played out and will therefore create false results after the first 52 inputs.
